#  A Computer Vision Example (MNIST Data)

This repository demonstrates how to build and experiment with a neural network for a computer vision task using the Fashion MNIST dataset. Through a series of exercises, you will learn how to preprocess image data, design and compile models in TensorFlow, and explore the effects of various neural network configurations and training strategies.

## Overview

In this project, we train a neural network to classify images of clothing from the Fashion MNIST dataset, which contains 70,000 grayscale images (28x28 pixels) spanning 10 different classes. The neural network is built using TensorFlow's Keras API and includes key concepts such as:

- **Data Normalization:** Scaling image pixel values from 0–255 to 0–1.
- **Flattening:** Converting 2D image arrays into 1D vectors.
- **Dense Layers:** Adding fully connected layers with activation functions like ReLU and Softmax.
- **Model Training & Evaluation:** Using training/test splits to evaluate model performance.
- **Callbacks:** Stopping training early when a desired accuracy is achieved.

## Dataset

The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 70,000 images representing 10 classes of clothing items (e.g., T-shirt/top, trouser, pullover, dress, coat, sandal, shirt, sneaker, bag, ankle boot). You can see a visual overview of the dataset below:

## Code Walkthrough

The repository is organized into several sections that build upon each other to illustrate key computer vision concepts:

### 1. Setting Up the Environment

- **TensorFlow Version Check:**  
  The code starts by importing TensorFlow and printing its version.

  ```python
  import tensorflow as tf
  print(tf.__version__)
  ```

- **Dataset Loading:**  
  The Fashion MNIST dataset is loaded via `tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist`, which automatically splits the data into training and test sets.

  ```python
  mnist = tf.keras.datasets.fashion_mnist
  (training_images, training_labels), (test_images, test_labels) = mnist.load_data()
  ```

### 2. Data Visualization and Normalization

- **Displaying an Image:**  
  Use Matplotlib to visualize a sample image from the dataset.

  ```python
  import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
  plt.imshow(training_images[0])
  print(training_labels[0])
  ```

- **Normalization:**  
  Normalize pixel values to the range 0–1 for easier training.

  ```python
  training_images = training_images / 255.0
  test_images = test_images / 255.0
  ```

### 3. Model Design

- **Building the Model:**  
  A sequential model is defined with:
  - A `Flatten` layer to convert 28x28 images into 784-dimensional vectors.
  - Dense hidden layers (with ReLU activation) for feature learning.
  - A Dense output layer (with Softmax activation) to generate probabilities for each of the 10 classes.

  ```python
  model = tf.keras.models.Sequential([
      tf.keras.layers.Flatten(),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(128, activation=tf.nn.relu),
      tf.keras.layers.Dense(10, activation=tf.nn.softmax)
  ])
  ```

- **Compiling the Model:**  
  The model is compiled using the Adam optimizer and sparse categorical crossentropy loss function.

  ```python
  model.compile(optimizer=tf.keras.optimizers.Adam(),
                loss='sparse_categorical_crossentropy',
                metrics=['accuracy'])
  ```

### 4. Model Training and Evaluation

- **Training:**  
  Train the model using the `model.fit` function.

  ```python
  model.fit(training_images, training_labels, epochs=5)
  ```

- **Evaluation:**  
  Evaluate the model on the test dataset to see how it performs on unseen data.

  ```python
  model.evaluate(test_images, test_labels)
  ```

- **Prediction:**  
  Generate predictions and compare them to true labels.

  ```python
  classifications = model.predict(test_images)
  print(classifications[0])
  print(test_labels[0])
  ```

## Exploration Exercises

The repository includes several exercises to deepen your understanding of neural network design and training. Below are brief summaries of the exercises provided:

1. **Exercise 1: Interpreting Predictions**  
   - Examine the output probabilities of the model and understand what each number represents.
   - Compare predictions with true labels.

2. **Exercise 2: Adjusting Neurons in Dense Layers**  
   - Experiment with increasing the number of neurons (e.g., 1024) and observe the impact on training time and accuracy.

3. **Exercise 3: Removing the Flatten Layer**  
   - Understand the role of the `Flatten` layer by observing errors when it is removed.

4. **Exercise 4: Output Layer Configuration**  
   - Investigate the effect of having an incorrect number of neurons in the output layer (e.g., using 5 instead of 10).

5. **Exercise 5: Adding Additional Layers**  
   - Explore the impact of adding extra hidden layers on model performance and complexity.

6. **Exercise 6: Varying the Number of Epochs**  
   - Observe how training for more epochs affects model accuracy and the risk of overfitting.

7. **Exercise 7: Effect of Data Normalization**  
   - Compare model performance with and without normalization of the image data.

8. **Exercise 8: Using Callbacks for Early Stopping**  
   - Implement callbacks to halt training once a specified accuracy threshold is reached, saving time and computational resources.

Each exercise is provided as a code snippet within the repository. You can modify and run them to see firsthand how changes in the model or training process impact the results.
